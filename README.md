# Multi-Class Image Classification and Naive Bayes Document Classification
## Implements two different neural network architectures to do image classification with the CIFAR-10 image dataset. Goal is to better understand how to build different neural neutwork architectures for image data and implement a multi-class classifier. Training ussing GPU in Google Colab.
